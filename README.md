# Configure and use Puget in Cider.

Configure and use [Puget](https://github.com/greglook/puget)
in [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
with [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).  Cider provides a Puget
already as an option for pretty printing.  In addition there is already
a [lein plugin](https://github.com/greglook/whidbey) to use Puget in a REPL.
So why is this software necessary?

This package provies provides a Puget (and ANSI coloring) in a Cider REPL.
Specifically:

* Puget binds dynamic variables for configuration, which is good, but this
  doesn't allow easy configuration via Cider.  This package allows a one time
  (i.e. REPL startup) to (re)configure.
* Include Emacs Lisp to easily configure the lisp cider project.

## Obtaining

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget/)


## Configuration

In your `profiles.clj` file (or add like configuraiton to `projects.clj`):

```clojure
{:user ...
 :dev {:dependencies [[com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget "0.0.1"]]}}
```

Create your Puget configuration anywhere you want, say for example
`~/.init.clj`:
```clojure
(require '[zensols.nrpuget.core])

(->> {:print-color true
      :color-scheme {:keyword [:none]
                     :delimiter [:blue]
                     :number [:magenta]
                     :tag [:black]
                     :symbol [:red]
                     :string [:green]
                     :character [:bold :green]
                     :boolean [:black]
                     :nil [:black]}}
     zensols.nrpuget.core/set-options!)
```

Add the [Emacs extension](src/emacs/nrepl-puget.el) to your `load-lib`, like
for example in `~/.emacs.d`.

Next, in your [`~/.emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) file
add the following (**note** refer to the configuration file you created
earlier):
```emacs
(require 'nrepl-puget)
(require 'cider)

(defun my-init-cider-connected-hook ()
  (let ((src (expand-file-name "~/.init.clj")))
	 (if (file-exists-p src)
	     (let* ((buf (find-buffer-visiting src))
		    (killp (not buf))
		    (buf (or buf (find-file-noselect src))))
	       (unwind-protect
		   (cider-load-file src)
		 (unless killp
		   (kill-buffer buf))))))

(add-hook 'cider-connected-hook 'my-init-cider-connected-hook)

(setq cider-pprint-fn "zensols.nrpuget.core/pprint"
      cider-repl-use-pretty-printing t)
```

## Usage

After you [configure](#configuration) you'll should see Puget formatting in the
REPL output (i.e. results from evaluation and cider functions like
`cider-pprint-eval-last-sexp`.  However, you can optionally get all of your
output through formatting using (for example) `println` but adding the
following to your Clojure source files:

```clojure
(ns example.my-namespace
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [println])
  (:require [zensols.nrpuget.core :refer (println)]))
  
(println ['asym #{"hash" :set} "string" 123])
```

Which produces
```clojure
=> [asym #{"hash" :set} "string" 123]
```

## Dynamic Width and Length of Ouptut

Per the Cider use case, `cloijure.pprint/*print-right-margin*` and
`*print-length*` are passed to Puget
when
[`println`](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nrepl-puget/codox/zensols.nrpuget.core.html) is
used.  However, these can be overriden by setting `:width-override` and
`:seq-limit-override` (for `*print-length*`).

An example use case is setting the size of your frame:
```emacs
(defun set-width (width)
  (set-frame-width frame width)
  (let ((width (window-width)))
    (-> (format "(zensols.nrpuget.core/option-assoc! :width-override %d)" width)
        (nrepl-request:eval #'(lambda (&rest args))
                            (cider-current-connection)))))
```
