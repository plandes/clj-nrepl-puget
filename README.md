# Configure and use puget in Cider.

Configure and use [Puget](https://github.com/greglook/puget)
in [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
with [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).  Cider provides a Puget
already as an option for pretty printing.  In addition there is already
a [lein plugin](https://github.com/greglook/whidbey) to use Puget in a REPL.
So why is this software necessary?

This package provies provides a Puget (and ANSI coloring) in a Cider REPL.
Specifically:

* Puget binds dynamic variables for configuration, which is good, but this
  doesn't allow easy configuration via Cider.  This package allows a one time
  (i.e. REPL startup) to (re)configure.
* Include Emacs Lisp to easily configure the lisp cider project.


## Obtaining

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget/)


## Configuration

In your `profiles.clj` file (or add like configuraiton to `projects.clj`):

```clojure
{:user ...
 :dev {:dependencies [[com.zensols.tools/nrepl-puget "0.0.1"]]}}
```

Create your Puget configuration anywhere you want, say for example
`~/.init.clj`:
```clojure
(require '[zensols.nrpuget.core])

(->> {:print-color true
      :color-scheme {:keyword [:none]
                     :delimiter [:blue]
                     :number [:magenta]
                     :tag [:black]
                     :symbol [:red]
                     :string [:green]
                     :character [:bold :green]
                     :boolean [:black]
                     :nil [:black]}}
     zensols.nrpuget.core/set-options!)
```

Add the [Emacs extension](src/emacs/nrepl-puget.el) to your `load-lib`, like
for example in `~/.emacs.d`.

Next, in your [`~/.emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) file
add the following (**note** refer to the configuration file you created
earlier):
```emacs
(require 'nrepl-puget)

(defun my-init-cider-connected-hook ()
  (let ((src (-> "~/.init.clj"
		 expand-file-name)))
    (if (file-exists-p src)
	(cider-load-file src))))

(add-hook 'cider-connected-hook 'my-init-cider-connected-hook)

(setq cider-pprint-fn "zensols.nrpuget.core/pprint"
      cider-repl-use-pretty-printing t)
```

## Usage

After you [configure](#configuration) you'll should see Puget formatting in the
REPL output (i.e. results from evaluation and cider functions like
`cider-pprint-eval-last-sexp`.  However, you can optionally get all of your
output through formatting using (for example) `println` but adding the
following to your Clojure source files:

```clojure
(ns example.my-namespace
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [println])
  (:require [zensols.nrpuget.core :refer (println)]))
  
(println ['asym #{"hash" :set} "string" 123])
```

Which produces
```clojure
=> [asym #{"hash" :set} "string" 123]
```
